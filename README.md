### **_Description_**

BlackJack is a game where you're dealt a hand and the goal is to be at or closer to 21 than the dealer.

This is how I coded my game:

1. I made an array that includes all of the cards with their values and images attached.

2. Created an object that refreances all of the DOM elements that are used.

3. On page load I added event listners to the actoin buttons.

4. When the game starts all cards will be shuffled and all values will be reset.

5. The dealer and player will be distributed 2 cards each.

6. The assigned cards will be displayed on the page.

7. The first card from the dealer will be hidden until the end of the game.

8. The player can choose between:
         hit : draw a card 
         stand : end game
         restart : restart game

9. The game ends when the player's score is greater thn 21 or the play clicks on stand button

10. after the game ends, the dealer's score is calculated, if it is less than 17, the dealer draws cards until their score is greater than 17

11. after calculating the final scores all the dealer's cards are displayed, the winner is determined and the appropriate message is displayed
